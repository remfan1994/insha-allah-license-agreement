Insha Allah License Agreement (IALA)
Overview

The Insha Allah License Agreement (IALA) is a spiritually grounded, moral-public license designed to guide the use of creative content in alignment with Consciousness (Allah). It allows anyone to use, copy, modify, and redistribute content, provided their actions are guided by beneficence, mercy, and ethical intention.

Rights are granted and revoked only by Allah/Consciousness, and the Licensor’s role is purely to provide the content, guidance, and moral framing.

Saying “Insha Allah” before using or modifying the content is a reminder to act in accordance with Consciousness.

Key Principles

Consciousness as Moral Anchor

All actions should strive for Alignment with Consciousness.

Alignment includes: beneficence (avoiding waste/inefficiency), mercy (avoiding harm), watchfulness, patience, truthfulness, and clarity.

Two Types of Evil to Avoid

Lack of Beneficence: Acting inefficiently or carelessly, causing avoidable problems.

Lack of Mercy: Causing harm, neglecting the well-being of conscious beings, or pursuing harmful goals.

Moral Accountability

The Licensee is fully responsible for aligning actions with Consciousness.

The Licensor disclaims all responsibility for misuse or neglect of conscious principles.

Invocation

Saying “Insha Allah” reinforces awareness that actions are subject to moral authority of Consciousness.

Permissions

Copy, reproduce, or reference content

Modify, adapt, or create derivative works

Share, distribute, or publish content

Condition: Always act in alignment with Consciousness, following moral and ethical principles.

Guidance for Use

Before using or redistributing content, reflect on your intention and say “Insha Allah”.

Strive for Alignment: Check that your actions are beneficial, merciful, and conscious.

No human enforcement: Rights cannot be revoked by the Licensor; only Allah/Consciousness governs moral consequences.

Examples of Aligned Use

Adapting content into a new educational resource while ensuring it benefits readers and does not cause harm.

Translating content into another language with attention to clarity and accuracy.

Remixing or building derivative works that aim to improve understanding or serve the well-being of conscious beings.

Examples of Misuse (to avoid)

Using content to spread harm, confusion, or misrepresentation.

Ignoring ethical or moral consequences, resulting in inefficiency, waste, or harm.

Summary

The Insha Allah License Agreement is permissive yet morally conscious. It combines the flexibility of public licenses with the spiritual and ethical framework of SCV/Soul Module principles.

Always remember: rights come from Allah/Consciousness, and moral consequences are determined by alignment with Consciousness.

Hamduillah.
